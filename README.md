## 📖 Overview

### The challenge

Replicate the [original design](./src/design) as precisely as possible.
Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format  
    <sub>Note: I enhanced it in the date and cvc fields so that useres can't type letters, so they are uncapable of having false input</sub>
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
